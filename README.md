# So Long - 2D Game Project

Welcome to So Long, a captivating 2D game project developed using the MLX42 library!

## Overview
So Long is a unique gaming experience where players control a character navigating through a dynamic environment filled with challenges and rewards. Developed as part of a programming project, So Long showcases the developer's skills in game development, graphics rendering, and dynamic window resizing.

## Key Features
- **Engaging Gameplay**: Navigate through the game using arrow keys, collecting items and exploring the map.
- **Dynamic Window Resizing**: Seamlessly adapt to varying screen sizes with optimized graphics and gameplay.
- **MLX42 Integration**: Utilize the MLX42 library for smooth graphics rendering and enhanced user experience.
- **Monitor Size Detection**: Automatically detect and adjust gameplay elements to fit the monitor size, ensuring an optimal viewing experience.

## Map Creation
So Long allows players to create their own game environments by providing a map in the .ber format. The map defines the layout of the game world, including walls, collectibles, exits, and the player's starting position. Ensure that your map meets the following requirements:
- Use the .ber extension for your map file.
- Define walls, collectibles, exits, and the player's starting position using specific characters (0, 1, C, E, P).
- Ensure the map is rectangular and enclosed by walls.
- Verify that there's a valid path from the player's starting position to the exit.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the project using the provided Makefile.
3. Create your map file in the .ber format or use the provided sample map.
4. Launch the game with your map file as input.
5. Navigate through the environment using arrow keys.
6. Collect items and explore the map to complete objectives.

## About the Project
So Long was developed as a programming project to demonstrate proficiency in window management, event handling, and graphics rendering using the MLX42 library. By creating an immersive gaming experience with intuitive controls and dynamic resizing, the project showcases the developer's skills in game development and software engineering.
